### Contributions: 
Project done solo by Epiphany Chua

### Problems: 
No known problems/errors. 

### Improvements:

This project utilizes only HTML and CSS. The use of Javascript would allow for multiple inputs to be added at once, such as entering multiple expiration dates when adding a new item.
